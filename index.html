    <h2>Now and Then of Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Climate change is a pressing global issue that requires collective action. Let's work together to create a sustainable future.
        <br><br><br>Situation 1:<b>Hurricane Otis Alters Acapulco, Mexico</b><br>On Oct. 25, 2023, Hurricane Otis knocked over power lines,
         uprooted trees, and unleashed torrential
        flooding and landslides as it made landfall in Acapulco, Mexico, as one of the strongest storms in recorded history to hit 
        the area. Acapulco, home to nearly 1 million people, is at the foot of steep mountains and surrounded by green tropical forests. 
        Over a week after the category 5 storm made landfall, sediment runoff from excess rainfall that turned surrounding vegetation 
        brown can still be seen.
        <br><br>Situation 2:<b>Breakup of Sea Ice in the Amundsen Gulf, Canada</b><br>Each spring, sea ice from the winter months breaks apart
         and melts as temperatures start getting warmer in the Amundsen Gulf in northern Canada. In May 2023, the sea ice in the eastern 
         part of the gulf quickly broke up, leaving behind ice chunks. By August, the Amundsen Gulf is usually ice-free.
         <br><br>Situation 3:<b>Snowy Southern California</b><br>A late-February storm blanketed parts of Southern California in snow, 
         including much of the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles, as seen in a satellite image from February 26, 2023. The 
         storm even brought 2 inches (51 millimeters) of snow to low-elevation areas such as La Crescenta, a suburban community north 
         of Los Angeles that sits at 2,000 feet (610 meters)
